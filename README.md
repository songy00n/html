<strong>Digital Hanaro HTML5 Course</strong>

HTML5, short for Hypertext Markup Language 5, is the latest version of the HTML specification used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It introduces several new features and improvements compared to its predecessor, HTML4.

<i>Some key features and capabilities of HTML5 include:

1. Semantic elements: HTML5 introduces new semantic elements that provide a clearer and more meaningful structure to web documents. These include elements such as /<header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>,/ and more. Semantic elements make it easier for search engines, screen readers, and developers to understand the purpose and hierarchy of different sections within a web page.

2. Multimedia support: HTML5 includes native support for embedding and playing multimedia content without the need for third-party plugins, such as Adobe Flash. The <video> and <audio> elements allow developers to embed video and audio content directly into web pages, providing better cross-platform compatibility and improved performance.

3. Canvas element: HTML5 introduces the <canvas> element, which provides a drawing surface for dynamically rendering graphics and animations using JavaScript. It allows developers to create interactive charts, graphs, games, and other visualizations directly within the web page without relying on external plugins or technologies.

4. Form enhancements: HTML5 introduces new input types, attributes, and validation features that enhance the functionality and usability of web forms. New input types such as date, email, number, range, and color provide better input control and validation. Additionally, HTML5 introduces the placeholder attribute for providing hints or examples within form fields.

5. Offline and storage capabilities: HTML5 provides features for creating web applications that can work offline and store data locally. The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs allow developers to store and retrieve data on the client-side, providing a way to build web apps that can function even when the user is offline or experiencing a weak internet connection.

6. Geolocation: HTML5 includes the Geolocation API, which allows web applications to request and access the user's location information. This enables location-aware web applications, such as mapping services, weather apps, and location-based search functionalities.

7. Responsive design: HTML5, in conjunction with CSS3 and JavaScript, supports responsive web design techniques. This allows developers to create websites that adapt and respond to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent and optimized user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

8. Accessibility improvements: HTML5 introduces new features and elements that improve web accessibility. These include the <main>, <figure>, and <figcaption> elements for better document structure, the alt attribute for providing alternative text for images, and the aria-* attributes for enhancing accessibility for screen readers and assistive technologies.</i>
